This project uses LangChain to perform RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) on PDF files, allowing users to ask any questions related to their contents. When a PDF file is uploaded, it is embedded and stored in an in-memory Chroma vectorstore, which the chatbot uses as a source of knowledge when aswering user questions.
